The language of this agreement is English and all notices and information given under this agreement will be in English.\n                  13 Payment services information\n                  13.1 This condition 15 only applies if the supplier’s bank is located within the qualifying area and the payment services being carried out are transacted in sterling or euro.\n                  13.2 We will ensure that any transaction you make is credited to the supplier’s bank, or that returned funds following redemption or cancellation are credited to your bank by the end of the business day following the day on which the transaction order is received, with the following exceptions:\n                  Transactions that are not:\n                  13.2.1 Executed wholly within the qualifying area in euro under a payment scheme which operates across the qualifying area;\n                  13.2.2 Executed wholly under a payment scheme which operates across the qualifying area and executed wholly in the United Kingdom in sterling; or\n                  13.2.3 Executed wholly under a payment scheme which operates across the qualifying area and involving only one currency conversion between the euro and sterling, provided that—\n\n                  13.2.3.1 the currency conversion is carried out in the United Kingdom; and\n                  13.2.3.2 in the case of cross-border payment transactions, the cross-border transfer takes place in euro.\n                  will be credited by the end of the fourth day following the day on which the transaction or order is received.\n                  13.3 If you make a payment directly from your account to another person within the qualifying area and it arrives later than it should have, you can ask us to contact the receiving bank to ask that they treat the payment as if it was made on time.\n                  13.4 In the unlikely event that you spend on your card without knowing the exact amount at the time of authorising the payment (for example, at a hotel), we won’t knowingly block any additional funds in your account beyond the amount requested from the merchant. As soon as we can confirm the exact amount you need to pay, we’ll release any additional blocked funds straight away.\n                  13.5 If you use your card or provide your card details to a supplier to make a transaction before you know the amount that is going to be charged to your card, then you may be entitled to request a refund if the amount is greater than expected, provided that you tell us within eight weeks of the date the transaction is deducted from your balance. You will not be entitled to a refund if you have been told by us, or the supplier, of the amount of that transaction at least four weeks before the transaction is due to be deducted from your balance, and you consented to the transaction.\n                  13.6 On receipt of such a request under condition 15.5, we may require you to provide us with information to ascertain whether the conditions in condition 15.5 have been met. Within 10 days of receiving a request from you under condition 15.5 or on receiving any additional information required under this paragraph, we will provide a refund or justify why we are refusing the request.\n                  13.7 We are liable for the correct execution of the transaction unless we can prove that the transaction was received by the supplier’s bank, in which case the supplier’s bank is liable to the supplier. You may request that we make immediate efforts to trace an incorrectly executed transaction and notify you of the outcome.\n                  13.8 When a supplier initiates a transaction it is the supplier’s bank that is liable for the correct transmission of the relevant details to us. If the supplier’s bank can prove that it is not responsible for a transaction that has failed or has been incorrectly executed, we will be responsible for you.\n                  13.9 If we are responsible for an incorrect amount of a transaction being deducted from your balance, we will correct the error. If we are responsible for a transaction being deducted from your balance which you did not authorise, we will refund the amount of the transaction to your balance and treat the transaction as if it had never occurred. You must inform us of any unauthorised or incorrect transaction as soon as possible and in any event no later than 13 months after the debit date. If you do not do so, we may not be liable.\n                  13.10 We are not liable if you make a payment to the wrong recipient. In such a case, we will make reasonable efforts to recover the funds involved. If you let us know of a payment you’ve paid to the wrong person by mistake over 13 months later, we’ll do our best to trace the payment, but we may charge you a reasonable fee to do this.\n                  14 Complaints\n                  14.1 If you would like to make a complaint or contact us for any other reason connected to these terms and conditions please contact us in ways described on the website.\n                  15 Contacting us\n                  15.1 You can contact us in the ways set out on our website.\n                  16 How we’ll contact you\n                  16.1 We’ll contact you by email, secure message or by telephone.\n                  17 Fee Information Documents\n                  17.1 .

Please carefully review and consider the terms of this\n                    statement, if you do not agree to the statement, you must immediately stop the use of the\n                    Services.\n\n                    We may at any time amend this statement, include but not limited to any policy or instruction on the platform. We shall notify you these changes either through marking the amended versions with latest release date on the top of the statement, or any other method we decide that is appropriate. Any changes or modifications will take effective immediately upon posting on this website and applies to all current and subsequent use or services.\n                    If you continue to use any of the Services you shall be deemed to have agreed to the revised terms of this statement. If you do not agree to the statement, you must immediately stop the use of the Services. You are advised to review the statement regularly to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions.\n\n                    1. This statement is a summary of the policies and procedures which we have implemented to reduce the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. This statement only covers the use of the Orbiter and other policies may apply for customers receiving separate services from us or our partners (such as the use of a debit card).\n\n                    2. Due to new UK anti-money laundering legislation which is due to enter into force on 10 January 2020, Orbiter will become subject to the UK anti-money laundering regime. As a matter of best practice, we have decided to comply with these requirements before this date. We are already subject to a number of other laws in the UK, including the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Terrorism Act 2000.\n\n                    What is money laundering/terrorist financing?\n\n                    1. Money Laundering is the process whereby criminals conceal the actual ownership and origin of the proceeds of criminal activities. The phrase ‘money laundering’ can cover all methods used to obscure the identity of illegally obtained assets so that they can be used for legitimate purposes.\n                    2. Terrorist financing is the use of financial systems and infrastructure to fund terrorism.\n\n\n                    Customer Due Diligence\n                    3. We will seek from customers such information as is necessary in order to verify their identity in accordance with the requirements which exist under the UK's anti-money laundering regime. We may use third party sources to verify information about customers or may require customers to produce copies of documents which evidence their identity.\n\n                    4. Customer due diligence will be conducted on a risk-sensitive basis, with customers posing the highest risk being required to provide more information than customers who pose a low risk. We have in place policies and procedures to recognise when there is a higher risk of money laundering. Customers who are also considered politically exposed persons (PEPs) will be identified and be subject to a more stringent verification procedure.\n\n                    5. If we are unable to verify a customer's identity, we will not enter into a business relationship with that customer or allow that customer to make a transaction on the Orbiter. If we consider that a customer poses a sufficiently high risk of money laundering then we will not enter into a business relationship with that customer.\n\n                    6. Evidence of a customer's identity will be retained by us for at least 5 years from the date that the relationship with the customer comes to an end. All data collected by us in discharging its anti-money laundering obligations will be processed in accordance with our privacy policy which can be found on the website.\n\n                    Transaction Monitoring\n                    7. Once a customer's identity has been verified, we have ongoing obligations to monitor transactions which occur on the Orbiter to determine whether a customer's transactions are suspicious.\n\n                    8. We have in place policies and procedures which allow us to recognise which transactions are suspicious and merit further investigation.\n                    Organisational Procedures\n                    9. We have appointed a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) who will be responsible for overseeing our anti-money laundering function, ensuring that all disclosures which are required by law are made (including any suspicious activity reports) and reporting to the board of directors with an annual report on the compliance with the money laundering regime.\n\n                    10. We train all relevant staff so that they are familiar with the process for verifying the identity of customers and to recognise the signs that there may be an increased risk of money laundering and how to deal with that increased level of risk.\n\n                    11. The MLRO and our board of directors will regularly review the policies and procedures to ensure that they remain effective in preventing the use of the Orbiter for money laundering and terrorist financing.\n                    Sanctions Regime\n                    12. In addition to complying with the UK's anti-money laundering regime, we follow policies and procedures to comply with the UK's sanctions regimes.\n\n                    13. Checks are undertaken to ensure that potential customers are not listed on any sanctions list maintained by the UK Government. We will not allow any person who is on a sanctions list to use the Orbiter to make a transaction."}},mounted:function(){switch(this.$route.query.id){case"1":this.content=this.content1,this.name="orbiterwallet注册协议";break;case"2":this.content=this.content2,this.name="隐私政策";break;case"3":this.content=this.content3,this.name="Cookie政策";break;case"4":this.name="AML政策",this.content=this.content4;break}},methods:{goBack:function(){this.$router.push("/login/agreement")}}}),i=r,s=(t("4a2d"),t("2877")),u=Object(s["a"])(i,n,a,!1,null,"4473903a",null);o["default"]=u.exports},"40f8":function(e,o,t){},"4a2d":function(e,o,t){"use strict";t("40f8")}}]);
